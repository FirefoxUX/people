      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The objective of this study is descriptive, not a hypothesis test. What’s the
        difference? Essentially, we are not dividing our users to groups where some get
        the treatment (search suggestion) and control (as it is now).  Therefore, it is
        okay to use Telemetry data.</p>
      <p>With telemetry, we cannot measure things on a per-user basis (only
        per-session or per-hour), so the data is going to be noisy, but it should
        hopefully be enough to show trends.</p>
      <p>To have something to compare against, we need to be recording the following
        things now (before we launch search suggestions):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Total number of searches</li>
        <li>Total number of searches from new tab</li>
        <li>Total number of searches from about:home</li>
        <li>Total number of searches from urlbar</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once we land search suggestions, we will add the following probes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Total number of searches from new tab that used search suggestion</li>
        <li>Total number of searches from about:home that used search suggestion</li>
        <li>Total number of searches from urlbar that used search suggestion</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>We will look the total searches / total session by BuildID
          <ul>
            <li>This will answer “Did the total number of searches change?”</li>
            <li>Looking at BuildID will control of day effect \o/</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We will look at search locations / total session
          <ul>
            <li>This will answer “Where did people search?”</li>
            <li>Also, we can see if the search location changed over BuildID</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We will look at search suggestions
          <ul>
            <li>This will answer “Did people use the search suggestion feature?”</li>
            <li>We don't have historical data to compare, so we will show
              something like “x% of searches from new tab used search
              suggestion”</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We will look at bogus protocols
          <ul>
            <li>This will answer “Did people use the bogus protocol feature?”</li>
            <li>We don't have historical data to compare, so we will show
              something like “x% of searches from the urlbar had a bogus
              protocol”</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Urls with bogus protocols.</h3>
      <img src="images/bogus-url.png">
      <p>To measure the number of searches we get from this change, we will rely on
        UITelemetry and FHR. We are measuring the number of searches from the urlbar
        in both, and we are
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1038248">measuring the
          number of keyword searches</a> from the urlbar in UITelemetry. From
        the UITelemetry measurements, we can calculate the added number of searches
        due to the keyword search feature for Nightly, Aurora, and Beta, and then
        map that to FHR to approximate the number of extra searches on Release.</p>
      <p>Christina ran an analysis on the data we have from FHR, and it showed no
        statistically significant changes to the number of searches. This is somewhat
        expected, since keyword searches are a bit of an wizard-level feature, and
        the people who would have used them in the past will have learned that they
        didn’t work.</p>

      <p>This might seem very similar to the previous bug. That’s because it is doing
        much the same thing, but for a different page.</p>

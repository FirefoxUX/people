#The new sharing indicator
The indicators for the various permissions are consolidated into one indicator that
acts as a single button.  If any device is being shared, the indicator is blue.
Permissions that have been requested but havenâ€™t yet been granted are shown as
dimmed icons.  Muted devices are shown as icons with a strike through.

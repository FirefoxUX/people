When a call fails, users are given the option to **retry** (if the contact is in fact a Loop user) or **send an email** with a pre-generated link to the contact they are trying to reach.

The Call Failed screen will also appear if a direct call is attempted to a non-Loop user, only without the Retry button.


####Arrived From:

1. Call failed because Loop contact is offline.
2. Call failed because contact is not a Loop user.

The dropdown for screen sharing includes thumbnails of the screens/windows
being shared.

Hovering an item in the list highlights that window/screen.  The visible part
of a window is highlighted with an outline and an overlay, the parts that are
hidden are just highlighted with a semi-transparent outline.

When the entry of an entire screen gets hovered, it gets an opaque outline
around the edges.

This window would appear when a user **clicks a Loop link** in a browser that has native support for Loop (i.e. Firefox after Loop lands).

The [legal copy](#start-call-legal) would only appear if the user had not yet dismissed the same information through the panel. This would only happen for users who receieve a link and are using a Loop-enabled browser, but have not yet opened the panel or interacted with Loop previously.

User can choose what type of call they would like to initiate with the [Call](#start-call-button) button (defaults to video).

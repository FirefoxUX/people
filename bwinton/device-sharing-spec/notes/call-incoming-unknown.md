#Call Label
Because a link was sent to a non-contact, the [URL](#incoming-call-url) is the only way to identify the incoming call. If the caller had entered a name (at link-generation time) for the call, this name would show up instead.

To give the user more information about the incoming call, we also show the [link-generation date](#incoming-call-date) (if available).

Again, Microphone and Video Camera [icons](#incoming-call-icons) indicate the type of incoming call (audio or video/audio).

###Import Contacts
This [button](#import-contacts) would open the Google Contacts permissions flow in a new tab. If contacts have already been imported from the service, the button would instead be labelled "Sync Contacts".

###New Contact
This allows the creation of a new _local_ contact.

###Contact List
Contacts imported from other services such as Google would have an icon on the right side to indicate their origin (and thus inform which actions they allow: e.g. you cannot edit an imported contact)
####Try

1. Editing a contact
2. Creating a new contact

When a page requests additional sharing permissions, the indicator in the URL bar
expands acordingly.  The doorhanger opens automatically.  If that kind of permission
hasn’t been requested before, the icon is dimmed in the indicator.

The permission for screen sharing (window, application or full screen) is special in
a few ways.  By default, no sharing a screen is selected as a security measure.  In
that state, the screen sharing icon is dimmed.  Once a screen/window is selected,
the icon gains full opacity.  The “Allow” button is disabled until a screen/app/window
is selected to prevent accidental clickthrough.

Devices that are already being shared are shown in a list below.  Each entry of that
list gives the user the option to stop sharing that device with the website.

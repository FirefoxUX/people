When a page requests access to devices, an indicator is placed in the URL bar
and a doorhanger opens.  Both show only the devices that the site has requested.

Audio devices have a meter bar next to them.

The “Deny” and “Allow” buttons have the “Deny and don’t ask again” and
“Always allow” items hidden behind the dropdown arrow.

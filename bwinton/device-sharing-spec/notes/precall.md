#Call Label
The [**tag icon**](#newcall-cog) allows users to add metadata (such as a call label or expiration date) to their call link. This must happen before sharing the link. The link URLs themselves are immutable.

#Latency
Generally the URL will appear with little to no delay, depending on it's local availabality and validity. In the case that a delay occurs, the text box which will eventually contain the URL should display the text "Loading..." in the grey, placeholder style (to indicate it is not selectable/editable). An indeterminate progress indicator could be displayed (i.e. a spinner) to show progress and dissuade the user from thinking the UI is frozen.

####Try
1. Changing your **availability** with the green [**availability indicator**](#availability-indicator)
2. Edit the details of your invitation by clicking the [**tag icon**](#newcall-cog)

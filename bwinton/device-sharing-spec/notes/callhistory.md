Clicking any of the items in the Call Log would attempt to initiate the appropriate action: if it is an outgoing link, the call should be connected. If it is a Direct Call, that contact should be called directly.

When a link is generated to share, it should show up here after either Copy or Share is clicked in the link-generation UI. Either the raw URL or the raw URL + label should be shown in the call history list.

* Red indicates a missed/failed call
* Arrows indicate incoming vs. outgoing (need better icons from visual team)

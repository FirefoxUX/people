If the user opens the doorhanger after one or more devices have been shared,
they get the option to mute on a per-device level.  The option to end all sharing
is prominent.

Because of technical limitations, it is currently not possible to change the
camera or microphone while sharing.  It should however be possible to change
the screen/window that is being shared.

The multiple stop buttons make the UI a little wordy here.  If someone has a
good idea for an icon, please share it!

The mute status of each device is also reflected in the list entry of that
device.
